# Property Details 

this small bit of ruby code retrieves the following property details from COJ.net:

* Property address
* Property locale
* Owner name
* Mailing address
* Mailing city
* Mailing state
* Mailing zip
* Year built
* Bedrooms
* Bathrooms


this requires a list of RE numbers which are currently hard-coded.

```$ ruby property_details.rb``` to generate a CSV file.
